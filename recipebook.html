        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To cook the right beef steak, you must first decide on the degree of roast (there are 5 of them, classic, but many choose Medium Rare, Medium and Medium Well) and choose a piece of meat of the desired thickness. <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 2:</strong> For the steak to turn out right, the meat must be completely dry before cooking - let it get wet.<br>
        <br> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, spices. Ground black pepper is traditionally used. It is better to grind it right before the very hot in a convenient way. But keep in mind - not to the state of dust, but to the state of such particles as in the photo.<br>
        <br> <strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you can already put the pan on gas - let it heat up, we need a well-heated pan (better - a grill). While the trial is up, salt a piece of meat, greased in front of this oil, roll in freshly crushed pepper, let it lie down, and then gently beat the surface with your fingers so that the salt and spices fix well on it.<br>
        <br> <strong>Step 5:</strong> If the pan is hot, pour oil into it. Warmed up? Immediately send the steak here, overlaid with spices, bay leaves, garlic, cut into slices. The oil should be greasy.<br>
        <br> <strong>Step 6:</strong> We do not leave the stove for a second. We need to catch the right moment, because the degree of roasting should be exactly what you have chosen. For a lightly browned steak, three minutes frying on both sides is enough. If you want a better crust, add more minutes, and so on. When turning over to the other side, never use a knife or fork. The juice should not run out. Therefore, we take something more comfortable and turn it over to the other side.<br>
        <br> <strong>Step 7:</strong> Is the steak ready? Take it out of the pan and serve. The steak is Medium Rare.

        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Put a large <em>saucepan</em> on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil.  <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.
            <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg often until it softens.
        <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.
        <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato purée, 1 beef stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped red chilli (if using), 125ml red wine and 6 halved cherry tomatoes. Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up the plum tomatoes.
        <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 6:</strong> Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins stirring occasionally, until you have a rich, thick sauce.
        <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 7:</strong> Add the 75g grated parmesan, check the seasoning and stir.
        <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 8:</strong> When the bolognese is nearly finished, cook 400g spaghetti following the pack instructions.
        <br>
        <br> <strong>Step 9:</strong> <em>Drain</em> the spaghetti and either stir into the bolognese sauce, or serve the sauce on top. Serve with more <em>grated</em> parmesan, the remaining basil leaves and crusty bread, if you like.
